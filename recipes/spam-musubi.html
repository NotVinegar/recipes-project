    <h3>A slice of spam, coated in a delicious sauce on top of a pad of rice, wrapped in a piece of nori.</h3>
    <p>Spam Musubi is a wonderful dish common in Hawaii, and my personal favorite struggle meal. For only $20 you can make enough to feed a family of 4! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sheets of sushi nori</li>
        <li>oyster sauce</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>spam or spam lite</li>
        <li>sushi rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour out 1 cup of sushi rice and follow instructions on the bag, typically 2 cups of water to 1 cup of rice, simmer for 30 minutes covered, then let sit off heat for 10 minutes covered, then let cool.</li>
            <li>Mix 1/4 cup of oyster sauce, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and 1/2 cup of sugar until smooth.</li>
            <li>Cut up the block of spam into 8 equal slices, then put it in a zip lock bag with the sauce and let sit while the rice cooks.</li>
            <li>While the spam is marinating and the rice is cooking cut your pieces of nori in half so you have 8 strips, I recommend folding it and then tearing along the fold.</li>
            <li>Bring a pan with your favorite oil (I recommend sesame) up to medium heat and lay down the slices of spam. You can some of the sauce on top for extra caramelization, but be careful not to have the heat too high so it doesn't burn. You can cook the spam to whatever level of doneness you like, or even not at all (although uncooked spam isn't nearly as good.)</li>
            <li>Now you need to decide how to assemble your spam, and there are three options. You can lay the nori out and assemble it freely, or use a spam assembler (available on amazon), or you can use the can the spam came in. I recommend free-handing it.</li>
            <li>Put the spam in the middle of the nori, then lay your rice on top. The rice will be very sticky if you made it right, so get your hands wet with cold water and put some salt on your palms to make it stick less.</li>
            <li>Finally, hurry and enjoy while it's still hot!</li>
        </ol>
